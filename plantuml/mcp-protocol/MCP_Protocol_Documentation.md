# MCP Protocol Documentation

## What is MCP Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables seamless integration between AI assistants and external tools, resources, and data sources. Unlike traditional approaches where tools are hard-coded or require custom APIs, MCP provides a standardized way for AI agents to discover, connect to, and utilize external capabilities while maintaining security and type safety through JSON-RPC 2.0 communication.

## MCP Protocol Complete Tool Selection and Execution Lifecycle Flow

### The Flow Covers:

#### 1. MCP Server Discovery & Initialization
- How AI agents establish connections with MCP servers
- Protocol version negotiation and capability exchange
- Client/server information sharing and session setup
- Authentication and authorization requirements

#### 2. Tool Discovery Phase  
- How agents discover available tools through standardized APIs
- Tool schema retrieval and input/output specification analysis
- Capability mapping and compatibility assessment
- Tool metadata parsing (descriptions, parameters, constraints)

#### 3. Intelligent Tool Selection & Planning
- How agents analyze user requests and decompose them into atomic operations
- Tool capability matching against task requirements
- Execution dependency graph creation and optimization
- Parameter validation and schema compliance checking

#### 4. Multi-Tool Orchestration & Execution
- Coordination between different tool types (File System, Web Search, etc.)
- Real-time data flow between sequential tool executions
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Tool lifecycle management (initialization → execution → cleanup)

#### 5. Verification & Result Aggregation
- Output validation and integrity checking
- Result compilation and user response preparation
- Session cleanup and resource management
