note right of Think
    **The Magic of Planning:**
    The agent doesn't try to solve
    everything at once. Instead, it:
    
    1. **Thinks** about the next step
    2. **Acts** using available tools  
    3. **Observes** what happened
    4. **Repeats** until done
    
    This allows handling complex
    tasks that require multiple
    steps and tools!
end note

note bottom of Question
    **Why Planning Matters:**
    Some tasks are too complex for
    a single response. Planning agents
    can break them into manageable
    pieces and execute step-by-step.
