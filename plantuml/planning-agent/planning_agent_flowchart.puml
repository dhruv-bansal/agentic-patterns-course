title **Planning Agent: ReAct Pattern Flowchart**\nStep-by-Step Process Flow

start

:**User provides complex task**;
note right
    Example: "Calculate sum of 1234 and 5678,
    multiply by 5, then take logarithm"
end note

:**THINK**: Analyze the problem
and decide what action to take;

:**ACT**: Call appropriate tool
with calculated parameters;
note right
    Available tools:
    • sum_two_elements()
    • multiply_two_elements()
    • compute_log()
end note

:**Wait for tool result**;

:**OBSERVE**: Receive and 
analyze tool output;

if (Task complete?) then (Yes)
    :**Provide final response**
    combining all results;
    stop
else (No, more work needed)
    :**Update context with
    new information**;
    :**THINK**: Plan next step
    based on current progress;
    detach
endif

note bottom
    **Key Characteristics:**
    • **Iterative**: Repeats until goal achieved
    • **Contextual**: Each step builds on previous results  
    • **Flexible**: Can adapt to unexpected outcomes
    • **Transparent**: Each step is explicit and traceable
end note

note top
    **ReAct = Reasoning + Acting**
    This pattern combines logical reasoning
    with the ability to take concrete actions,
    making AI agents much more capable
    of handling complex, multi-step tasks.
